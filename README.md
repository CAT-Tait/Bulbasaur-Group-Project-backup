## Title of Extension

Lord of the Land: Farm Enhanced

## Brief Overview of game

Fields Enhanced will expand upon its predecessor to allow the player more expansion of the farm with a bigger and/or new end goal. With the addition of audio and background music, the player will have a relaxing and more enjoyable time growing their farm. With the increase in crop growth time the player will have more time to expand their farm while also giving them a greater challenge as they will have to plan their crops around the time they take to grow so that their family doesnâ€™t starve.

Some new animals, along with a barn to store them, will also be added to the game, granting the player a larger selection of resources to sell or, if added, to be processed into new foods that can sell for a greater amount.

I may add in a timer so the player can test their time at beating the game, along with a few more crops and the ability to process the harvested materials into new foods/items to sell them for a larger amount of gold.

## Must Have Features

* **Audio** I intend to add audio where I can to the game, for example, chicken clucking when near chickens and a gentle background music.
* **Expanding animals** The ability to buy from a selection of animals (not just chickens) and have them appear in a new barn area to harvest.
* **Better end goal** The current end goal can be reached rather quickly and doesn't allow for much in-game growth so I will alter/change the end goal to a greater task, allowing the player to explore more in the game.
* **Altered growing times** Altering the growth rate of crops to slow down the speed of the game and give the player more of a challenge and a chance to expand.

## Should Have Features

* **Food processing** I am looking to add things to do with the harvested materials other than just sell. For example: Make bread with wheat or bake cake with eggs.
* **More crops** I should have a slightly larger variety of crops added to the game for the player to grow and harvest, each with different sell and buy rates and new things to do with them.
* **Timer** The game will include a hidden timer shown at the end to display how long it took you to beat it.

## Could Have Features

* **Farm expansion** The option to buy new fields/buildings/areas for the farm to grow more crops or find some kind of new material.
* **Request board** Some optional goals available via some kind of request board that give you rewards like gold or new seeds but are not required to complete the game.

## Wish to Have Features

* **Building element** Adding in some new areas that allow you to farm for resources like wood/stone to help build buildings of some kinds.
* **Nearby town** A small town of sorts with new buildings and NPCs where you can buy and sell things. This will also have the above-mentioned request board if implemented.
* **Combat** A new area where combat is available to sell some kind of monster drop for gold.
